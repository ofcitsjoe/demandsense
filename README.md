# 📈 DemandSense AI
### Retail Inventory Forecasting & Supply Chain Optimization using Machine Learning

DemandSense AI is an end-to-end machine learning project that forecasts retail demand using both statistical and deep learning approaches. The project compares forecasting models, estimates inventory requirements, and visualizes business impact through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The objective is to demonstrate how AI-driven demand forecasting can reduce overstock, minimize stockouts, and improve inventory planning.
